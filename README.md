# OOP_task
The most optimal container was list. So i compared two lists when whey are using stuctures and classes. The fastest method is when i create 2 new lists and put the right students into each. the numbers show that it was faster to work with structures than with classes. That is probably because i have to get access to the private members of the class to compare them in any way.
